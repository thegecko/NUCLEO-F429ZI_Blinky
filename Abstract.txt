The 'Blinky' project is a simple demo program for
ST 'STM32F429ZI' microcontroller using ST 'NUCLEO-F429ZI' Evaluation Board.
It is compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    = MCO =   8.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =       168.00 MHz

 - 3 LEDs blink
 - blinking is paused while holding down the USER button.

The Blinky program is available in different targets:
 - Debug:
   - ARM Compiler 6 optimization Level 1
   - Enabled Event Recorder
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Source'
 - Release:
   - ARM Compiler 6 optimization Level 3
   - Keil RTX5 variant 'Library'
